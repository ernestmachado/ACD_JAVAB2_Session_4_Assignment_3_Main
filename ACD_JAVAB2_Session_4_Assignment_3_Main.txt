Assume that class A extends class B, which extends class C. 
Also all the three classes implement the method test(). 
How can a method in a class A invoke the test() method defined in class C 
(without creating a new instance of class C).

Select the one correct answer.
a. test();
b. super.test();
c. super.super.test();
d. ::test();
e. C.test();
f. It is not possible to invoke test() method defined in C from a method in A.

Answer:
f. It is not possible to invoke test() method defined in C from a method in A.

Since the test() method is overridden we cannot call test() directly. Thus option a is not right.
Also super.test() in the method of class A will call the method of class B and not class C. Thus it rules off option b.
super.super.test() and ::test() is incorrect.
Also C.test() will need to create an instance of class C which is prohibated.
Thus the answer is f.
